# QOSF-task
Implementation of a simple quantum circuit simulator.

This project was developed as a part of the admission screening task of the QOSF Mentorship (batch of january 2021). [Here](https://github.com/quantastica/qosf-mentorship/blob/master/qosf-simulator-task.ipynb) you can find the task requirments.

The three codes are fundamentally the same, but qc_basic.py has only the basic requirments of the task, in qc_parametric_gates.py I've implemented the use of parametric gates and in qc_variational_algo.py I've allowed global parameters.
