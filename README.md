# QOSF-task
Implementation of a simple quantum circuit simulator.

The three codes are fundamentally the same, but qc_basic.py has only the basic requirments of the task, in qc_parametric_gates.py I've implemented the use of parametric gates and in qc_variational_algo.py I've allowed global parameters.
